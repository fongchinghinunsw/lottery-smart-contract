1. Users can enter lottery with ETH based on a USD fee
2. An admin will choose when the lottery is over
3. The lottery will select a random winner

Since we have an admin here, this means that our application isn't necessarily going
to be truly decentralized because we have a single person chooses when the lottery is
over, we could intead choose a random participate being the admin or we could have the
lottery automatically open and close based off some time parameters.
